# A '#' represents a comment and everything after it is skipped
# Lines starting with # or blank lines are skipped
# Lines starting with @ are blocks/directives and describe how the build is going to be processed
# One line for each setting, no multiple settings on same line, line indentation does not matter
# Blocks with =[] define LISTS (arrays)
# Blocks with ={} define MAPS (hashmaps)
# Blocks with =[{}] define ORDEREDMAPS (array of hashmaps)
# Blocks with = or nothing define VALUES (single value)
# A key and/or value can be quoted (with ", ' or `, quotes) or unquoted
# Lines with one or multiple '@'s define the end of that many previous blocks
